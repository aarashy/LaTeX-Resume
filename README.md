# LaTeX-Resume
A resume template for software developers, adapted from https://github.com/sb2nov/resume. 
I think having a statement of purpose and giving brief explanations of the raison d'Ãªtre of the companies and projects 
I have worked on in the past will help resumes based on this template stand out. 

To get started, you can copy-paste this over to a new project in [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/)
