# LaTeX-Resume
A resume template for software developers, adapted from https://github.com/sb2nov/resume. 
Having a statement of purpose and giving brief explanations of the raison d'Ãªtre of each company and project will help resumes based on this template stand out. 

To get started, you can copy-paste this over to a new project in [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/)
